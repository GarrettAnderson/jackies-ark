        Red Cross trained in Pet First Aid/CPR. Able to administer meds,
        subcutaneous fluids and injections. I am a sole proprietorship. I am the
        only sitter who will set foot on your property and I protect your
        domicile as I do your pets. I advocate for the best veterinary care
        available to all pets, whether traditional western, holistic or
        complimentary. I am very knowledgeable about dog/cat nutrition and have
        helped many clients successfully transition their animal companions to
        healthier diets whether home cooked, raw, canned or dry. For many years
        I enjoyed a working relationship with the foremost retailer of high end
        pet nutrition in Orlando and counted their pets among my clientele.{" "}

      <p>
        A healthy lifestyle is not only what I advocate for my clients, it is
        also the intention with which I live my own life. I love cycling,
        gardening and just about anything that keeps me outdoors!
